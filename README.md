# ClassNotifier

Uses Pushover API and the UF Courses API to gather waitlist data about a specific class. Every 60 seconds the program will check if a waitlist position is available and send push notification to the user with a message of the course code.

Right now this is for personal use and requires and account with Pushover API, but the repo can be cloned and tweaked to work on another device.
